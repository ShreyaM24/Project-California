### ✅ Next steps I recommend
- Add a `requirements.txt`
- Clean folder naming (`data/`, `notebooks/`)
- Optional: screenshots of graphs in README

If you want, I can:
- ✨ Customize this README for **college submission**
- 🌐 Make it **portfolio-ready**
- 🧠 Tailor it specifically to **what your dataset actually is**

Just tell me 💙
```
